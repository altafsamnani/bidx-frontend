Adds Competition functionality to Bidx websites.

== Description ==

Admin functionality allows creation of Competitions and Judges.
They get their own page at /competition/[name of the competition].

There are two widgets one for the countdown and one for registration.
They work for the logged in and for the not logged in. Registration is one-click.
After that a person that is logged in and is registered sees only the information.

The widgets can be called using shortcodes [competition id=""] for the countdown.
[competition-registration id=""] for the registration part.
